# Docusaurus 3 Hello World Page Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. SpecifyPlus Workflow Adherence
All new feature development, including page creation, MUST strictly follow the SpecifyPlus workflow (spec -> plan -> tasks -> implement). No deviations or shortcuts are permitted.

### II. Docusaurus 3 Best Practices
New pages and components MUST adhere to Docusaurus 3 classic template best practices for structure, styling, and configuration, utilizing TypeScript where applicable.

### III. Modularity and Reusability
Page components and logic SHOULD be designed with modularity and reusability in mind. Avoid tightly coupled code.

### IV. Content-First Approach
Focus on clear and concise content delivery. The "Hello World" page should demonstrate basic content rendering without unnecessary complexity.

### V. Testability
Components and logic, where applicable, SHOULD be testable to ensure correctness and prevent regressions.

## Technology Stack

This project uses Docusaurus 3, React, and TypeScript. All new code should be written in TypeScript.

## Development Process

Features are developed using the SpecifyPlus workflow. Code reviews are mandatory for all changes.

## Governance
Amendments to this constitution require a documented proposal and approval from the project lead. All changes must follow semantic versioning.
